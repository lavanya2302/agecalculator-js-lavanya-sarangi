🧮 Built a Simple & Responsive Age Calculator using JavaScript!
I'm excited to share my latest mini project – an Age Calculator built with:

✅ HTML5
🎨 CSS3 (custom + Bootstrap 5)
⚙️ JavaScript
📦 Bootstrap Icons

👤 Users can input their Date of Birth and the Current Date to calculate their exact age in years.
📱 Fully responsive layout using Bootstrap, styled with Google Fonts and icons for a clean user interface.
💻 This project helped me practice date manipulation, DOM interaction, and responsive design!
